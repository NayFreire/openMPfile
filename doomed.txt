Doomed
Bring Me The Horizon

Cut off my wings and come lock me up
Just pull the plug, yeah, I've had enough
Tear me to pieces, sell me for parts
You're all vampires, so here

You can have my heart (my heart, heart)
You can have my heart (my heart, heart)
You can have my heart (my heart, heart)
You can have my heart (my heart, heart)

The world's a funeral, a room of ghosts
No hint of movement, no sign of pulse
Only an echo, just skin and bone
They kicked the chair but we, we helped tie the rope

You can have my heart (my heart, heart)
You can have my heart (my heart, heart)
You can have my heart (my heart, heart)
You can have my heart (my heart, heart)

So come rain on my parade
'Cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge
'Cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it's too late
And it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And now there's no way back

You must have made some kind of mistake
I asked for death, but instead I'm awake
The devil told me: No room for cheats
I thought I'd sold my soul, but he kept the receipt

So leave a light on Iâ€™m coming home
It's getting darker but I'll carry on
The Sun don't shine but it never did
And when it rains, it fucking pours
But I think I like it
And you know that I'm love with the mess

I think I like it

So come rain on my parade
'Cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge
'Cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it's too late
And it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And now there's no way back
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And now there's no way back

So come rain on my parade
'Cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge
'Cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it's too late
And it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And now there's no way back
